As the training goes on, he grows closer to both Tanjiro and Nezuko, and he sheds tears of joy, when Tanjiro returns from the Demon Slayer exam alive, as he is the first to do so after a long string of deaths. He has since kept a close eye on their growth. He has given his word to the Pillars that if Nezuko were to eat a human, then Tanjiro, as well as Giyu and himself would kill her and themselves in atonement.

            <h2>The Sound Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Sound Hashira and former shinobi. Exuberant and proud, Tengen always strives to do things "flashy". While he is somewhat arrogant and condescending, Tengen harbors deep regrets over his life as a shinobi like being forced to kill some of his siblings when their father ordered it, joining the Demon Slayers in the hope to atone for it. He has three wives who served as kunoichi and assist in his mission, eventually retiring as a Hashira after losing his left hand and eye from fighting Gyutaro. He reappears in the final battle against Muzan, standing guard to protect Kiriya alongside Kyojuro's father. In the Reiwa Era. Tengen has a reincarnation/descendant named Tenma, an athlete who wins a gold medal in gymnastics.

            <h1>Shinobu Kocho</h1>
            <h2>The Insect Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Insect Hashira. She is rather cool-headed and always has a smile on her face, no matter what situation she is put in. She enjoys teasing others, mostly annoying Giyu Tomioka, about how no one likes him. Behind her cheerful facade, she harbors a deep rage towards all demons for taking the lives of her loved ones, including her older sister. Unlike the other Hashira, she does not have the strength to behead them, using instead a small, thin sword to kill demons by inoculating them with a wisteria-based poison she developed. Shinobu sacrifices herself to defeat Doma, having consumed massive doses of wisteria so Doma would be poisoned the moment he devoured her with Kanao and Inosuke finishing him off. Before her death, she also helped Tamayo with developing the cure for Nezuko's demon condition and a mix of poisons used on Muzan to greatly weaken him. In the Reiwa Era, she and Kanae are reincarnated as high school students.

            <h2>The Flame Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Flame Hashira after inheriting the title from his father Shinjuro. Though he comes off as boisterous and cheerfully eccentric, Kyojuro is pure-hearted and honorable due to his mother instilling in him a moral code of protecting the weak. He was assigned to investigate the Mugen Train, with Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Nezuko aiding him to dispatch Enmu. After their battle with Enmu, he meets Akaza of the Twelve Kizuki. Akaza proposes that Kyojuro turn into a demon so they can fight for all of eternity, to which Kyojuro flatly declines. He is ultimately killed by Akaza. After using his last moments to direct Tanjiro to his father, the youth had the tsuba of Kyojuro's broken sword installed into his new sword in respect of the Hashira. In the Reiwa Era, he is reincarnated as a teenage student.

            <h2>The Love Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Love Hashira and a former disciple of Ky≈çjur≈ç Rengoku. She has an overtly passionate, somewhat airheaded disposition. Her whip-like sword is made from a malleable metal that only she can properly wield. She possesses enhanced flexibility and abnormal physical strength due to having denser muscles than the average human. She joined the Demon Slayer Corps because she wanted a man that would love her to be stronger than her. She especially admires the other male Hashira and would always praise them in her mind. Thus, when she was mortally wounded during the final battle against Muzan Kibutsuji, she declared her love for Obanai Iguro, before dying alongside him. The epilogue shows her reincarnation in the Reiwa Era married to Obanai's as they run a restaurant together.

            <h2>The Serpent Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Serpent Hashira who is always accompanied by his pet snake, Kaburamaru. A harsh and ruthless young man, he possesses deep self-loathing for his past. He was raised by his family, an all-female clan of bandits, as an offering to a serpentine demon they worshiped, only to be rescued by Shinjuro Rengoku. He joined the Demon Slayer Corps as a means of venting his rage over how his family was destroyed by their association with the demon. He is infatuated with Mitsuri Kanroji and gets easily jealous when she becomes close to someone else. Despite being blinded during the final battle with Muzan Kibutsuji, he still manages to assist Tanjiro due to his connection with Kaburamaru, which allows him to continue fighting. He ends up mortally wounded and declares his love for Mitsuri, before dying alongside her. After his death, Kaburamaru's care is entrusted to Kanao Tsuyuri. The epilogue showed Obanai reincarnated in the Reiwa Era and married to Mitsuri as they run a restaurant together.</p>

            <h2>The Mist Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Mist Hashira. Outwardly nonchalant and indifferent, he possesses a fierce rage against demons that acts as his driving force to fight. He had an older twin brother who was killed by a demon when they were younger. Since then, he has always blamed himself for being the only survivor until Tanjiro manages to cheer him up. Due to the incident, he lost some of his memories, which was restored after realizing Tanjiro had the same red eyes as his father. He is killed in the battle against Upper Rank One, Kokushibo, who is revealed to be his distant ancestor. In the Reiwa era, he is reincarnated as a baby alongside his brother.

            <h1>Giyu Tomioka</h1>
            <h2>The Water Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Water Hashira. He is the first Demon Slayer that Tanjiro comes across. He initially tries to kill Nezuko but reconsiders after seeing her protect an unconscious Tanjiro. He sends them to his mentor Urokodaki in the hopes that Tanjiro could succeed him and possibly cure Nezuko. Seemingly aloof and unemotional, he does not think of himself as a true Hashira, despite mastering Water Breathing, due to an inferiority complex that stemmed from survivor's guilt during Final Selection. He has developed an additional exclusive form of Water Breathing, which he alone knows. He loses an arm during the final battle against Muzan but survives after the demon is killed. In the Reiwa Era, Giyu's reincarnation is a child named Giichi, who is close friends with Sabito and Makomo's reincarnations.

            <h2>The Wind Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Wind Hashira. A confrontational and aggressive individual, he attempted to prove Nezuko's demonic nature before the Hashira and Kagaya. Though he fails, he does not accept the Kamado siblings. As a teen, he witnessed the deaths of his siblings and was forced to kill his mother, who was transformed into a demon. He is the older brother of Genya Shinazugawa, his only surviving sibling, and continually shuns him, even though Sanemi actually intends to have his brother quit the Demon Slayer Corps so he can live a normal life. He is one of the two Hashira who survive the final battle against the Upper Ranks and Muzan Kibutsuji, the other being Giyu, though he loses two right fingers during his battle against Upper Rank One, Kokushibo. In the Reiwa Era, he is reincarnated as a police officer.

            <h2>The Stone Hashira</h2>
            <p>The current Stone Hashira and considered the strongest among them. A man of gigantic stature, Gyomei is a former monk who took care of orphaned children. After the children are murdered by a demon and he is framed for the crime, even though he protected them from it, he became more ruthless but still caring. He pities Tanjiro at first due to Nezuko being a demon, but later acknowledges him after seeing how honest he is. He is the only Hashira who does not use a sword, fighting with an enormous flail-like chained axe that only he can wield with ease due to his massive size and strength. He loses a leg in the final battle against Muzan Kibutsuji before dying from blood loss from his wounds. In the Reiwa Era, Gyomei is reincarnated as a kindergarten teacher.
